            <p>My hobby is Math because it can help you future on. I find math fun and entertaining as well as an overcoming challenge. I like to do Math and usually Maths when I really 
                can. Math is easy, fun, and can keep you busy for a while. I will also remember that this fun is also what can help you in the future and I can know that it is good for me.
